<p>While Javascript Server Side may seem easier, it&#8217;s a real mess to debug. So, I clearly prefer to use Java which avoid this kind of problems thanks to JPDA.</p>

<p>For example, use the following javascript snippet into a transition in an Alfresco Workflow based on jBPM (and generated with SIDE to make thinks a lot easier):</p>

<p>var node =bpm_package.children<span>0</span>;</p>

<p>var destination = node.parent.parent.childByNamePath(&#8220;achieved&#8221;);</p>

<p>if (node.shortType == &#8216;YAMMA:com_bluexml_side_yamma_OutgoingMail&#8217;) { destination = destination.childByNamePath(&#8220;mail&#8221;); } else if (node.shortType == &#8216;YAMMA:com_bluexml_side_yamma_Invoice&#8217;) { destination = destination.childByNamePath(&#8220;invoice&#8221;); } else if (node.shortType == &#8216;YAMMA:com_bluexml_side_yamma_Quotation&#8217;) { destination = destination.childByNamePath(&#8220;quotation&#8221;); }</p>

<p>node.move(destination); There is an error which is very difficult to diagnose if you don&#8217;t know it. The error message just tells you that there is a &#8217;}&#8217; missing at the 3rd line of your script. Well, in fact, nothing&#8217;s missing! You must just type node.shortType instead of node.typeShort to make things working smoothly!</p>

<p>You can try to activate the javascript debugger but it won&#8217;t be very useful because once loaded, the javascript code corresponding to your transition appears on one line. So debugging step by step is not very efficient.</p>

<p>What a difference with Java in which you have tools, mature and well tested, to help you to develop the code you need.</p>

<p>Thanks to JPDA, it&#8217;s really easy.</p>
