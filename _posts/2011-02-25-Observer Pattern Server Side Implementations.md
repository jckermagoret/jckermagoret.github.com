You just discovered Observer pattern in javascript on the client, and we already talk about server side implementations.

What does server side implementation add?

This means that once you developed the Observer pattern on your client side application, you can very easily extend it to provide easy and widespread messaging interop among languages, platforms and brokers. This basically means you can communicate messages to a lot of others users.

Server side implementation may be done through CometD, which is now part of dojo, which enable you to build very simple chat application for the most straight forward use case.
