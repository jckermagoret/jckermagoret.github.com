<p>Use case</p>

<p>I have a virtual system with a main host and various virtual machines. I want these virtual machines to have some directories shared with the main host so the backup will be easier.</p>

<p>Solution</p>

<p>I mount a directory on my main host into the virtual machine. To be the more flexible possible, the mounted directory is based on a logical volume I can increase or decrease according to my needs.</p>

<p>Implementation</p>

<p>On your main host, create a logical volume and format it. For example, if you have a volume group called data, you could do this:</p>

<p>lvcreate -L20G -n vz106 data mkfs.ext3 /dev/data/vz106 This creates a /dev/data/vz106, which corresponds to a 20GB disk, on your system. This new disk can now be mounted on a directory which is inside one of your container:</p>

<p>mount -n &#8211;bind /data/vz/106 /var/lib/vz/root/106/data To make everything automatic during the reboot, you can create corresponding files in your /etc/vz directory. On my system, I have:</p>

<p>/etc/vz/conf/106.mount:</p>

<h10>MACRO#0</h10>

<p>/etc/vz/106.unmount:</p>

<h10>MACRO#1#That&#8217;s all</h10>
