<p>The Problem To Address</p>

<p>One more time, to prepare a course, I had to browse all the documentation I wrote to find the right material I needed. Of course, I had to rewrite part of it because it was not structured the right way. I think it&#8217;s time to organize my content in a way I can reuse it.</p>

<p>The Solution</p>

<p>Some solution exist and are called Component Content System. Wikipedia gives us a very clear definition:</p>

<p>A component content management system (CCMS) is a content management system that manages content at a granular level (component) rather than at the document level. Each component represents a single topic, concept or asset (e.g., image, table, product description). Components can be as large as a chapter or as small as a definition or even a word. Components in multiple content assemblies (content types) can be viewed as components or as traditional documents. So, in short, I want unit of imformation at an enough low level granularity so I can recreate the content I want it by simply recombining it by hand, through automatic queries based on classification, structure, &#8230;</p>

<p>The Reality</p>

<p>Well, it looks like DITA or Docbook.</p>

<p>DOCBOOK</p>

<p>I already used Docbook and it&#8217;s true you can do amazing things but you need to write everything in XML according the docbook schema. OOo does not support it very well and it&#8217;s a little too complex for non technical users. I tried docbook2odp, which generate clean OOo Presentation but you still need to work with Docbook. I had a look to wiki syntax, such mediawiki, because there is an XML extension to get Docbook format. Unfortunately, exporting preformatted code gives a poor result, so I need to fix it manually. Too boring.</p>

<p>I had a look too at rST (reStructuredText) to generate OOo Presentations with rST2odp which almost don&#8217;t need to be fixed. Moreover, you can apply an OOo Presentation template during rST to odp generation. Unfortunately, there are no tools to convert mediawiki to rST.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>My requirement is finally very simple. How to make all these tools communicate so I can use my preferred input type and get my preferred output for the tasks I have to achieve? Of course without fixing or rewriting anyting. Just reuse?</p>

<p>I guess I need to go further on DITA which seems the way to go.</p>
