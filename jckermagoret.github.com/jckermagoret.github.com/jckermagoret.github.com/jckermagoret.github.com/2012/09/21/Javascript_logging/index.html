<p>When you want to develop in javascript, you look for usual tools in programing languages. One of the best tool in Java is log4j. It&#8217;s a tool to help developers to insert information in their code and display this information according the configuration. I t means you may have test and production configuration without the need to change anything.</p>

<p>I gave a glimpse to google about javascript and logging and it gave me back 2 answers which seem of interest. It was:</p>

<p>log4js log4javascript I first gave a try to log4js because of its name, very similar to the log4j for Java. Unfortunately, it didn&#8217;t work correctly with my javascript application, because of a conflict.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t go further and tried log4javascript. It worked immediately like a charm. Here is the magic lines. Just add the following at the top of your html page:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/resources/common/js/misc/log4javascript.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

                    log4javascript.setEnabled(true);
                    var pua = new log4javascript.PopUpAppender();
                    log4javascript.getDefaultLogger().addAppender(pua);
                    log4javascript.getLogger(&quot;SIDE.Observer&quot;).addAppender(pua);
                    log4javascript.getLogger(&quot;SIDE.Tree&quot;).addAppender(pua);

                    // You can define explicitely a var to set the log level
                    var lsa = log4javascript.getLogger(&quot;SIDE.Authenticate&quot;);
                    lsa.setLevel(log4javascript.Level.INFO);
                    lsa.addAppender(pua);
                    log4javascript.getLogger(&quot;SIDE.Util&quot;).addAppender(pua);
                    log4javascript.getLogger(&quot;SIDE.Preview&quot;).addAppender(pua);</code></pre>

<p>As stated in the code, you can define explicitely a var to set the log level.</p>

<p>It works very well and the log window does the job.</p>

<p>To conclude, log4js would certainly do the job but for any reasons, it didn&#8217;t when I tried. Nevermind, these tools are mature and they work the same way, so don&#8217;t be worry. Take the one that does the job for you the fastest.</p>
