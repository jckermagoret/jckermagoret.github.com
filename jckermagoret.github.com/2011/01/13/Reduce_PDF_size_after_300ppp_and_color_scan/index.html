<p>Use Case</p>

<p>To manage paper documents in YaMma (Yet Another Mail Management Application), I do the following actions:</p>

<p>scan 24bits-colors, 300ppp for good quality process them to ocr reduce their size create a pdf with the text from ocr embedded into the pdf For a document of 17 pages, its size is about 170Mo after such a scan. While this quality is interesting for OCR, there are about 10K documents into the company intranet and I can&#8217;t put a file with such a size into my content repository&#8230;</p>

<p>So the need for a solution to reduce the size of the document.</p>

<p>Solution</p>

<p>I can choose and configure my output from my scan:</p>

<p>quality (100, 200, 300, 600, 1200ppp) color (B&amp;W, 8, 16, 24 bits color) output type (pdf, image, &#8230;) I generally choose PDF output, 300ppp, 24 bits color and my scanner (a very cheap Brother DCP6690CW) finally creates such a file after creating a TIFF file for each page and concatenating them all together.</p>

<p>To reduce file size, I then can:</p>

<p>reduce all TIFF files through convert (ImageMagick) and concatenate them into a pdf one directly reduce PDF file through ghostscript (gs) By following this second option (I haven&#8217;t studied the first one), I&#8217;m able to easily get a PDF file of about 1-3Mo with an enough good quality to have a correct reading.</p>

<p>Usage</p>

<p>Just get a ghostscript installation for your system. Then choose the quality you are looking for (screen &lt; ebook &lt; prepress, &#8230;)</p>

<p>gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=output.pdf input.pdf or</p>

<p>gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=output.pdf input.pdf You can specify options for better quality or to produce PDF/X or PDF/A. Just have a look at the gs options on the manual. For a 160Mo PDF file, you will finally get a 1Mo file with screen option and 3Mo file with ebook one. Ebook quality is really better.</p>
