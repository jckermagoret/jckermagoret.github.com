<p>Use Case</p>

<p>In a multi-tenant Alfresco, I want to be able to use IMAP4, which is not supported in this situation, except for the host (the main tenant).</p>

<p>A work around consists in mounting other tenants through webdav to be able to copy content from one tenant to another, and then to extract meta-data through a content rule. This feature sounds like the replicate one which is unfortunately unavailable on multi-tenant systems.</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>The Alfresco host server acts like the main tenant which receives mails for other tenants then, through webdav, copied them to other tenants.</p>

<p>In very short, Replicate = WebDAV + Content Rule</p>

<p>Solution</p>

<p>The solution is based on mount.davfs.</p>

<p>You can install it through the davfs debian package. Just do:</p>

<p>apt-get install davfs Mount.davfs Configuration</p>

<p>You then need to edit:</p>

<p>/etc/davfs/secrets, to indicate for each mount point the user and passwd to use /etc/davfs/certs/yourserver.pem, to indicate the certificate for your alfresco webdav server, using SSL My /etc/davfs/secrets file contains the following:</p>

<p>/mnt/davfs/test2-admin admin@test2 xxxx /mnt/davfs/test1-admin admin@test1 xxxx /mnt/davfs/demo2-admin admin@demo2 xxxx /mnt/davfs/demo1-admin admin@demo1 xxxx /mnt/davfs/main-admin admin xxxx where xxxx must be replaced by your password for each tenant. You can of course make some mountings with other user accounts than the admin one.</p>

<p>You can then mount your webdav server on your mount point. For example:</p>

<p>mount -t davfs https://your.alfresco.server/alfresco/webdav /mnt/davfs/main-admin where /mnt/davfs/main-admin is a directory you created before the mount command</p>

<p>You can then use your remote alfresco server like any usual file systems and copies the data.</p>

<p>For example, I do:</p>

<p>cp -rf /mnt/davfs/main-admin/Imap\ Home/admin/INBOX/Alfresco/* /mnt/davfs/test1-admin/Sites/test1/documentLibrary/test/Alfresco Meta-data Extraction Through Content Rule</p>

<p>E-mails are now available in my tenant, but they aren&#8217;t seen like emails. So, I need to extract the meta-data corresponding to e-mails. To achieve that, I just have to create a content rule which will be triggered on new elements. This content rule will extract common meta-data from freshly copied emails.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a little hacky but it does the job!!!</p>
